I only made this if someone would make their own Expansion for this Mod.

Here's a list of Global Tags that would needed for the Activator to Bond with the Main Mod:

#Activators

"customExpansion" - Custom Expansion 1
"customExpansion2" - Custom Expansion 2
"customExpansion3" - Custom Expansion 3
"miniExpansion" - A mini expansion that only contains few features, also Special Like Zombie Faction (Just an Example lol)

#Skipping Tags
#NOTE: It doesn't make any since if you add Prev Actions as it always trigger it

"skipSelection" - Used to Skip Custom 1
"skipSelection2" - Used to Skip Custom 2
"skipSelection3" - Used to Skip Custom 3

#Miscellaneous but still useful

"hideAtreidesFaction" - Hides Atreides Faction
"hideOrdosFaction" - Hides Ordos Faction
"hideHarkonnenFaction" - Hides Harkonnen Faction

Alright! Thanks for Reading (^_^ )
