Arrakis: Spice Wars (or ASW for short) is a mega mod based off Westwood's original Dune games (DUNE II, Dune 2000, Emperor: Battle For Dune) with some extra features and things from Westwood's Command & Conquer franchise. It features many units from across the games while keeping DUNE II's simplistic artstyle.

# WARNING
At the moment, Arrakis: Spice Wars is not at all properly functional, with many, many problems still in the mod. Heck, its not even at a proper ready for release state. I highly recommend waiting until a release has been made, as those hopefully run much more stable with less bugs appearing. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
