Arrakis: Spice Wars (or ASW for short) is a mega mod based off Westwood's original Dune games (DUNE II, Dune 2000, Emperor: Battle For Dune) with some extra features and things from Westwood's Command & Conquer franchise. It features many units from across the games while keeping DUNE II's simplistic artstyle.
