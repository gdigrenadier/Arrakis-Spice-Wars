title: Arrakis: Spice Wars (v0.5)
description: Using Hyasabaru's DUNE II mod as a basis, Arrakis: Spice Wars is a mod that basically combines all the Dune RTS games with some other additions into one while using DUNE II's artstyle. \n DISCLAIMER: All the assets like sound effects and sprites are Westwood Studios', originally used for the original game made back in the 90s. \n Thank you Hyasabaru for making such a excellent mod. \n Made by GDI Grenadier.
